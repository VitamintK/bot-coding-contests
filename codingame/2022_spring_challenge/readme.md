My first contest! Learned about it through a tweet from https://twitter.com/fakepsyho

Proud to make it to the highest league: Legend! Ended up not modifying my code at all once hitting Legend, so I got 314th/394 in Legend, which is 314th/7,699 overall. Really impressed at the active community and amount of participants here! It was really fun.
